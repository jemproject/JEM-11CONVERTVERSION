<h3>Repeating Events</h3>

<p>Choose the rythm of the recurrance: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or at a single weekday of the month.
If you only want to create events until a certain date, set a 'By the end of' date. 
See the explanation in the remark below.</p>

<br />

<div class="attentionheader">Attention</div>
<div class="attention">For all of the recurrency-options you can enter a 'By the end of' date. JEM will generate your event for the 
repeating interval that you have chosen, until the end date, <strong> BUT </strong> it will never create events that exeed 
the number of days ahead that you defined in the Settings -> Global parameters -> Advanced Parameters -> [Generate events up to (days).
<br />
<br />
This is called the 'Anticipation Window' (the number of days that JEM looks ahead) and is always leading. 
Recurring events can be auto-generated by JEM for a shorter period ahead, but never for a longer period than defined there. 
This is to protect busy websites with many event submissions by users from heavy database load.
</div>

<p><strong>Daily:</strong>
Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X calendar days. You can choose from 1 (every day) till 14 days. 
Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.
</p>

<p><strong>Weekly:</strong>
Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X weeks. You can choose from 1 (every week) till 8 weeks. 
Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.
</p>

<p><strong>Monthly:</strong>
Choose this if you want the event to repeat every X months. You can choose from 1 (every month) till 12 months. 
Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.
</p>

<p><strong>Weekday:</strong>
Choose this if you want the event to repeat every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc of the month. 
You can also choose the 'last' or the 'before last'. Then set until what date JEM should create your recurring event.
</p>
Once again, please note that the anticipation window that you set in the Settings of JEM will allways be leading when the enddate is evaluated.



<h3>Metadata information</h3>
<p>
<strong>Metadata information: </strong>Enter or edit (if needed) the Meta Description and the Meta Keywords of the event here. 
You may use the suggestions in the settings to set default values which will be automatically set to the event data.</p>
