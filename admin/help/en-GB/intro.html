<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
  JEM is an Event Management Component for Joomla.
  It's not a calendar but an easy way to manage and present your events for your group, company or community.
  JEM offers a lot of features and possibilities which make your work easier, like the Venue database, Event recurrence, Venue geotagging and much more.
  But also for your site visitors JEM has some additional features to offer, 
  like a simple registration system, map service links, or the submission/edit of events and venues from the site Frontend. <br />
  

<h2><strong>Quickstart guide</strong></h2>

<br />
After the successful installation of JEM you need to take at least 3 steps.

<br />
<br />

The first one is to configure the settings you need in
the JEM configuration. Set the format of the date and
time, enable image thumbnail creation and set the layout of the table columns.
Optionally you can integrate the <a href="http://www.joomlapolis.com" target="_blank">community builder</a> enhanced user profile component in the settings. Most of the settings
are self explanatory. If not, move your mouse pointer over the text
to get more detailed information or click on the help icon in the
toolbar.

<br />
<br />

The second step is to create the categories. Every event you create
must be assigned to a category. For example, if you have a music site you could
use  Rock, Rap, Dance, Electronic, etc. <br />
For each category you can set access permission levels. All events assigned to this category will
only be visible for the group you have given access to.

<br />
<br />

The third step is to create the menu item in the Joomla!
menu manager. JEM offers 18 different menu views: <br />


<ul>

<li>A Calendar View</li>

<li>A Category Listing</li>

<li>A Category Listing (detailed)</li>

<li>A Category Calendar</li> 

<li>A Single Category Listing</li>

<li>A Listing of the Current Day</li>

<li>An Event Submission Form</li>

<li>A Venue Submission Form</li>

<li>A Single Event View</li>

<li>A Simple List of Events</li>

<li>My Attendances</li>

<li>My Events</li>

<li>My Venues</li>

<li>A Search Form</li>

<li>A Venue Calendar</li>

<li>A Single Venue</li>

<li>A Venues Listing</li>

<li>A Week Calendar</li>

</ul>

<br />
If you have taken these steps you are ready to input your events.
If you want to assign your events to venues you first have to create the venue information. 

<br />
<br />
